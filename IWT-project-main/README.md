# IWT-project
As part of our IWT assignment, we've developed "BillMe," an online bill and event reminder platform chosen with group consensus. This platform enables users to pay bills, create event reminders, plan monthly budgets, and ask questions about web application issues. Our vision is to help users remember upcoming events and pay related or unrelated bills via an online portal, including their budget plans.

Users can set calendar reminders for events and payments, ensuring they are notified of both the event date and the payment deadlines. The platform also allows users to create budget plans and make utility payments, streamlining their monthly tasks and notifications.

Admin users have the ability to edit content and manage users and staff. We are building this web application using HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript.
